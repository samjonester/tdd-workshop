# TDD Workshop

This repository is a workshop created by Sam Jones to aide in the exploration and teaching of TDD.

There are stater applications to help you write tests in Ruby, JavaScript, and Java. If you write in another language please add it here. PR's welcome!

# Workshop

For the workshop we will be doing something similar to [Global Day of Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/). We will be working with [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). We will have two sessions focused on a different TDD activity. After each, we will have a short group retro to discuss what we did and what we learned.

## Activity 1
Test Drive the 4 rules. Create something that will accept a cell and it's neighbors. It will then execute the rules of the game. This will get us comfortable with the idea of writing tests and also the problem domain.

## Activity 2
Use Top-Down TDD to design the entrypoint into the game. Use tests to design each unit and break the problem up into focused units. Pick the most interesting and repeat the process.
